# test-workflows
It's originally just to learn about how GitHub Actions work... but now... well...

*  Learn about workflows depending on other workflows
*  Learn about invoking command-line programs from gradle
*  Learn about making pytest-cov work with PR's

(Also, I say "learn", but what I really mean is "experiment"... anyways...)
